

Adding SSL Support for Perl SMS Software Development Kit

Prerequisites
-----------------------------------------------

1. Version 2.6.0 or above of SMS SDK


Unix/Linux
-----------------------------------------------

1. Ensure normal TCP/IP functions properly by setting up
all proper dependencies for Net::SMS

2. Install Crypt::SSLeay so that internal LWP::UserAgent
can access https URLs.

  perl -MCPAN -e shell
  
  cpan> install Crypt::SSLeay
  
3. SSLeay will require that OpenSSL is installed.
Most Linux distributions already come with OpenSSL
installed.

4. Set $sms->secure(1); so that SSL is used to
send the SMS versus normal TCP/IP.

5. If you run into a problem, please try to turn the
debug mode on to see more problems revealed:

$sms->debug(1);


Windows (ActiveState Perl)
-----------------------------------------------

ActiveState does not provide a pre-compiled or PPM
version of Crypt::SSLeay.

Simplewire will NOT support SSL on Windows until
ActiveState provides this.

However, there are numerous resources on the Internet
of users getting LWP::UserAgent to support SSL via
various installation methods.  Its not impossible
to get SSL to work on Windows, but Simplewire will
not support questions regarding this issue until
ActiveState supports it.
