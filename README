Release Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------

2.6.4 - April 30, 2004

    * Fixed backwards compatability bug with version <= 3.9.7
      of the WMP Server.

2.6.3 - April 5, 2004

    * Fixed Carrier/Network List bug

2.6.2 - February 12, 2004

    * Fixed Unicode text message bug -- some platforms failed
      to properly convert characters resulting in submission
      errors.

2.6.1 - January 25, 2004

    * Fixed minor XML formatting bug.
    
    * Addded recv_text.pl example show how to receive incoming
      SMS from Simplewire.
      
    * Added first version of the test suite.

2.6.0 - July 21, 2003

    * Added WAP push support.

    * Added account() command to query network for real-time
      credit balance.

    * Methods submit(), query(), list(), account() all return
      a true or false based on success() property.

    * Implemented mobile originated SMS (receiving SMS) to support
      version 2.0 and 2.5 of the WMP protocol.

    * Verified and fixed all issues to verify module works in
      both "-w" and "-Tw" modes.
      
    * Deprecated functions -> new equivalent functions
      - msgSend() = submit()
      - msgStatusSend() = query()
      - carrierListSend() = list()
      
      - msgPin() = destAddr()
      - msgCallback() = sourceAddr()
      - proxyServer() = proxyHost()

    * Backwards compatability broken on ServerName and ServerDomain
      properties.  These will NOT effect normal use of the SDK even
      if you previously used them.
      
    * Many other functions are renamed to adapt to new, upcoming
      standards going to be introduced in version 3.x.x of the SDK.
      All previously named functions are mapped to the new names
      meaning all previous code is backwards-compatible.

    * Fixed "unquoted string may conflict with future reserved word"
      bug when Perl is run in -w or warning mode. 

    * Added SSL support, see Secure property for more information
      on how to use this new feature.
      
         $sms->secure(1);
      
    * Added debug output to help debug connection problems, network
      settings, and general problems.
      
         $sms->debug(1);

    * Deprecated ServerName, ServerDomain, and ServerPort.  Please
      see RemoteHost and RemotePort.
      
    * Modified internal variables by renaming them:
        ServerName, ServerDomain = RemoteHost
        ServerPort = RemotePort
        ServerFile = RemoteFile
        Removed ServerProtocol since that is internally used.

    * Modified RemotePort function to default to 0 which stands
      for "unused".  If unchanged, SDK will connect over port
      80 and if "secure" is true, then SDK will connect over
      port 443.  However, any update of RemotePort will cause
      the SDK to manually connect to that port.

    * Modified default remote host to wmp.simplewire.com not
      wmp-test.simplewire.com.
